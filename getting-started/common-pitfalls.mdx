## Order Issues

### Failed Orders

**Important**: A returned order ID with HTTP 200 does **not** guarantee the order was successfully processed. Failed orders don't generate user-visible errors unless a required field is missing.

<Note>
To ensure your order was successfully processed, always verify its status via the order stream. Do not rely solely on HTTP 200 responses or returned order IDs.
</Note>

**Common failure reasons:**
- Invalid Account
- Expired Instrument
- Insufficient Balance

## Authentication Issues

### Invalid Client Errors

If you receive `invalid_client` or `invalid_client_assertion` errors:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `invalid_client` | JWT signature verification failed | Verify private key matches registered public key |
| `invalid_client_assertion` | Malformed JWT or wrong claims | Check JWT claims (iss, sub, aud, exp) |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid or expired access token | Request a new access token |
| `403 Forbidden` | Missing required scope | Contact support to request additional scopes |

### Common JWT Mistakes

- Wrong `aud` claim (must be the token endpoint URL, not the API URL)
- Expired JWT (`exp` in the past)
- Reused `jti` (must be unique per request)
- Using development credentials in production (each environment requires separate keys)

See [Authentication](/getting-started/authentication) for the correct JWT structure.

## Connection Issues

### Error 464

When receiving a 464 error in prod or pre-prod environments, verify that the `Host` header is set correctly:

```bash
Host: rest.preprod.polymarketexchange.com
```
**OR**
```bash
Host: rest.prod.polymarketexchange.com
```

Without this header, requests are routed to gRPC by default instead of REST.

### Timeout / No Response

If requests hang without returning a response:

**Step 1: Verify Your Token**

Ensure your access token is valid and not expired:

```python
import base64
import json

# Decode the payload (middle part of JWT)
payload = access_token.split('.')[1]
payload += '=' * (4 - len(payload) % 4)  # Add padding
claims = json.loads(base64.urlsafe_b64decode(payload))

print("Token expires:", claims.get("exp"))
print("Granted scopes:", claims.get("scope", ""))
```

**Step 2: Check Endpoint URL**

Ensure you're using the correct API base URL for your environment:

| Environment | API Base URL |
|-------------|--------------|
| Development | `api.dev01.polymarketexchange.com` |
| Pre-production | `api.preprod.polymarketexchange.com` |
| Production | `api.prod.polymarketexchange.com` |

**Step 3: Verify Network Connectivity**

Test basic connectivity to the API:

```bash
curl -I https://api.preprod.polymarketexchange.com/v1/health
```

### Curl Command Drops to Blinking Cursor

If your curl command drops to a new line with a blinking cursor, this indicates a formatting issue with the command itself, not a connection problem.

**Common causes:**
- Missing quotation marks
- Missing escape characters
- Malformed command syntax

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Windows and Python HTTP/2

Windows instances and Python applications may encounter HTTP/2 compatibility issues:

- **Windows**: Ensure HTTP/2 is enabled
- **Python**: Use the `httpx` library instead of `requests`

```python
import httpx

# Use httpx for HTTP/2 support
with httpx.Client(http2=True) as client:
    response = client.get(
        "https://api.preprod.polymarketexchange.com/v1/health",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
    )
```

## Rate Limiting

### 429 Too Many Requests

If you receive 429 errors, you've exceeded the rate limit:

- Implement exponential backoff
- Cache responses where possible
- Use streaming endpoints for real-time data instead of polling

See [Rate Limits](/getting-started/rate-limits) for current limits.
