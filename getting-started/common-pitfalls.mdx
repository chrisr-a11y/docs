## Order Issues

### Failed Orders

**Important**: A returned order ID with HTTP 200 does **not** guarantee the order was successfully processed. Failed orders don't generate user-visible errors unless a required field is missing.

**Common failure reasons:**
- Invalid Account
- Expired Instrument
- Insufficient Balance

## Connection Issues

### Error 464

When receiving a 464 error in prod or pre-prod environments, verify that the `Host` header is set correctly:

```bash
Host: rest.preprod.polymarketexchange.com
```
**OR**
```bash
Host: rest.prod.polymarketexchange.com
```



Without this header, requests are routed to gRPC by default instead of REST.

### Timeout / No Response

If curl commands hang without returning a response:

**Step 1: Verify DNS Configuration**

Use the complete service name endpoint to test connectivity:

```bash
https://traderapi.us-east-1.privatelink.preprod.polymarketexchange.com/auth/v1beta1/register
```

If this URL works but your DNS/CNAME doesn't, the issue is with your DNS configuration.

**Step 2: Check Security Group Settings**

If the full endpoint also times out, review your VPC security group settings:

- Set inbound rules to `0.0.0.0/0` for all traffic
- Set outbound rules to `0.0.0.0/0` for all traffic
These settings are suggested for testing only and not recommended for production Security Groups

### Curl Command Drops to Blinking Cursor

If your curl command drops to a new line with a blinking cursor (`>_`), this indicates a formatting issue with the command itself—not a connection problem.

**Common causes:**
- Missing quotation marks
- Missing escape characters
- Malformed command syntax

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Windows & Python HTTP/2

Windows instances and Python applications may encounter HTTP/2 compatibility issues:

- **Windows**: Ensure HTTP/2 is enabled
- **Python**: Use the `httpx` library instead of `requests`

## AWS Connectivity

### Can't Connect to Service

If your AWS instance cannot find the service, verify your subnets match our availability zones.

<Warning>
Availability zone letter indicators (e.g., `us-east-1a`) can be mapped differently across AWS accounts. At least **one** availability zone ID must match.
</Warning>

**Production Availability Zones:**
- `use1-az1`
- `use1-az2`
- `use1-az6`

**Pre-Production Availability Zones:**
- `use1-az1`
- `use1-az2`
- `use1-az4`

<Note>
Subnet matching only applies when connecting from **within AWS us-east-1**. Connections from other regions are mapped automatically.
</Note>
