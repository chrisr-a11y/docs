# Common Pitfalls

This guide covers common issues when integrating with the Polymarket Exchange API.

## Order Issues

### Failed Orders

**Important**: A returned order ID with HTTP 200 does **not** guarantee the order was successfully processed. Failed orders don't generate user-visible errors unless a required field is missing.

<Note>
To ensure your order was successfully processed, always verify its status via the order stream. Do not rely solely on HTTP 200 responses or returned order IDs.
</Note>

**Common failure reasons:**
- Invalid Account
- Expired Instrument
- Insufficient Balance

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Windows & Python HTTP/2

Windows instances and Python applications may encounter HTTP/2 compatibility issues:

- **Windows**: Ensure HTTP/2 is enabled
- **Python**: Use the `httpx` library instead of `requests`

### Curl Command Drops to Blinking Cursor

If your curl command drops to a new line with a blinking cursor (`>_`), this indicates a formatting issue with the command itself—not a connection problem.

**Common causes:**
- Missing quotation marks
- Missing escape characters
- Malformed command syntax
