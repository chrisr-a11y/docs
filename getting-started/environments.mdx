# Environments

The Polymarket Exchange API is available in three environments. Use the appropriate endpoints based on your integration stage.

## Complete Endpoint Reference

## Quick Reference

### REST API Base URLs

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| Dev | `https://api.dev01.polymarketexchange.com` |
| Preprod | `https://api.preprod.polymarketexchange.com` |
| Prod | `https://api.prod.polymarketexchange.com` |

### gRPC Endpoints

| Environment | Endpoint |
|-------------|----------|
| Dev | `grpc-dev01.polymarketexchange.com:443` |
| Preprod | `grpc-preprod.polymarketexchange.com:443` |
| Prod | `grpc-prod.polymarketexchange.com:443` |

---

## AWS PrivateLink Connection

For secure, private connectivity from your AWS VPC, use AWS PrivateLink. This routes traffic over AWS's private network instead of the public internet.

### PrivateLink Endpoints

| Environment | PrivateLink DNS |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Preprod | `traderapi.us-east-1.privatelink.preprod.polymarketexchange.com` |
| Prod | `traderapi.us-east-1.privatelink.prod.polymarketexchange.com` |

### PrivateLink Ports

| Protocol | Port |
|----------|------|
| REST API | `443` |
| gRPC | `443` |

<Info>
The load balancer terminates TLS on port 443 and forwards to the internal gRPC service on port 9090.
</Info>

### Setup Requirements

1. **Allowlist your AWS account** - Contact support to allowlist your AWS Account ID
2. **Create VPC Endpoint** - Use the VPC Service Name for your environment
3. **Wait for approval** - Polymarket DevOps will approve the connection request
4. **Configure DNS** - Enable Private DNS or create CNAME aliases

### VPC Service Names

| Environment | VPC Service Name |
|-------------|------------------|
| Preprod | `com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0ab4dc57271d74d3e` |
| Prod | `com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0cb1220f882b3879e` |

### Authentication Endpoints

| Environment | Token URL |
|-------------|-----------|
| Dev | `https://auth.dev.polymarketexchange.com/oauth/token` |
| Preprod | `https://auth.preprod.polymarketexchange.com/oauth/token` |
| Prod | `https://auth.polymarketexchange.com/oauth/token` |

<Warning>
**Tokens must be refreshed every 3 minutes** across all environments.

## Environment Progression

We recommend the following integration progression:

1. **Dev** - Initial development and unit testing
2. **Preprod** - Integration testing and pre-launch validation
3. **Prod** - Live trading
