# Connectivity Pitfalls

This guide covers common connectivity issues, including AWS PrivateLink configuration.

## Connection Issues

### Timeout / No Response

If curl commands hang without returning a response:

**Step 1: Verify DNS Configuration**

Use the complete service name endpoint to test connectivity:

```bash
curl "https://traderapi.us-east-1.privatelink.preprod.polymarketexchange.com/v1/health" \
  -H "Host: rest.preprod.polymarketexchange.com"
```

If this URL works but your DNS/CNAME doesn't, the issue is with your DNS configuration.

**Step 2: Check Security Group Settings**

If the full endpoint also times out, review your VPC security group settings:

- Set inbound rules to `0.0.0.0/0` for all traffic
- Set outbound rules to `0.0.0.0/0` for all traffic
These settings are suggested for testing only and not recommended for production Security Groups

## AWS Connectivity

### Can't Connect to Service

If your AWS instance cannot find the service, verify your subnets match our availability zones.

<Warning>
Availability zone letter indicators (e.g., `us-east-1a`) can be mapped differently across AWS accounts. At least **one** availability zone ID must match.
</Warning>

**Production Availability Zones:**
- `use1-az1`
- `use1-az2`
- `use1-az6`

**Pre-Production Availability Zones:**
- `use1-az1`
- `use1-az2`
- `use1-az4`

<Note>
Subnet matching only applies when connecting from **within AWS us-east-1**. Connections from other regions are mapped automatically.
</Note>
