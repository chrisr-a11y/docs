## Connectivity Options

The exchange provides two supported integration protocols for client applications:

1. **FIX Protocol**  
   - **Type:** Financial Information eXchange (FIX)  
   - **Usage:** Standardized message format for order entry, trade execution, and market data.  
   - **Benefits:** Widely adopted in financial markets; high reliability for order flow and execution reporting.  

2. **REST API with gRPC Streaming**  
   - **Type:** HTTP-based REST interface combined with gRPC for real-time streaming.  
   - **Usage:** REST for request/response operations (e.g., placing orders, querying market state) and gRPC for low-latency, bidirectional data streams.  
   - **Benefits:** Simple integration for HTTP-based clients; gRPC enables efficient real-time data delivery.  

Both interfaces provide access to trading functionality and market data, allowing clients to select the protocol that best fits their integration requirements.
