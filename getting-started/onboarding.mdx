# Onboarding

Complete this onboarding process before you can authenticate and access the API.

## Step 1: Generate Your Key Pairs

Generate **two RSA key pairs** - one for pre-production (testing) and one for production. You will share only the **public keys** with Polymarket.

```bash
# Generate pre-production keys (for testing)
openssl genrsa -out acme_preprod_private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in acme_preprod_private_key.pem -pubout -out acme_preprod_public_key.pem

# Generate production keys
openssl genrsa -out acme_prod_private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in acme_prod_private_key.pem -pubout -out acme_prod_public_key.pem

# Generate fingerprints for both keys (you'll need these for verification)
openssl rsa -pubin -in acme_preprod_public_key.pem -fingerprint -noout
openssl rsa -pubin -in acme_prod_public_key.pem -fingerprint -noout
```

<Info>
**Key Naming Convention**

Replace `acme` with your company name. Your keys should be named:
- `{companyname}_preprod_public_key.pem` - for pre-production/testing
- `{companyname}_prod_public_key.pem` - for production

Both environments require separate keys for security isolation.
</Info>

<Warning>
**CRITICAL: Protect Your Private Key!**

Your private key (`my_private_key.pem`) must NEVER be shared with anyone, including Polymarket. If your private key is compromised:

- **Your account is at risk of unauthorized access**
- **Contact Polymarket immediately to rotate your credentials**
- Email: onboarding@polymarket.com

Secure your private key:
```bash
chmod 600 my_private_key.pem
```

Store it in encrypted storage or a secrets manager. Never commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create Your Onboarding Folder

Create a Google Drive folder for your onboarding submission:

1. Create a new folder in Google Drive named: **"[Your Company Name] - Polymarket API Onboarding"**

2. Add the following files to the folder:
   - **Pre-production public key** (`{companyname}_preprod_public_key.pem`)
   - **Production public key** (`{companyname}_prod_public_key.pem`)
   - **Onboarding Document** (`{companyname} Onboarding Document`) - following the [Onboarding Template](/isv-partners/onboarding-template)
   - **[Participant Agreement](/isv-partners/participant-agreement)** (`{companyname} Participant Agreement`)
   - **[Contact Form](/isv-partners/contact-form)** (`{companyname} Contact Form`)
   - **[Corporate Application](/isv-partners/corporate-application)** (`{companyname} Corporate Application`) - *only if applying as a corporate entity*

3. Share the folder with **Editor** access to: `onboarding@polymarket.com`

<Note>
**Upload the public key FILES, not the contents.** We need both actual `.pem` files in your shared folder - one for preprod and one for production.
</Note>

<Info>
Polymarket needs Editor access to provide your credentials (including your Client ID) in the shared folder after verification.
</Info>

## Step 3: Verification Call

After you share your onboarding folder:

1. The Polymarket team will review your submission
2. We will contact you using the information in your onboarding document
3. We will schedule a **recorded online meeting** with both Polymarket contacts present

<Warning>
**Identity Verification Required**

During the verification call:
- **Both contacts** from your company (primary and secondary) must be present
- Each contact must provide **government-issued photo ID** to verify their identity
- You will verbally confirm the fingerprints of **both** public keys

Have both key fingerprints ready:
```bash
openssl rsa -pubin -in {companyname}_preprod_public_key.pem -fingerprint -noout
openssl rsa -pubin -in {companyname}_prod_public_key.pem -fingerprint -noout
```
</Warning>

4. Once identity and key fingerprints are verified, both keys will be configured in the authentication system

## Step 4: Receive Your Client ID

After successful verification, Polymarket will add a `clientid.txt` file to your shared Google Drive folder containing your Auth0 Client ID.

<Info>
**Keep your Client ID secure.** You'll use it in the JWT authentication flow to obtain access tokens. See [Authentication](/getting-started/authentication) for details.
</Info>

## Step 5: Start Using the API

After your key is verified and configured:

1. You will receive your **Client ID** and environment details
2. Follow the [Authentication Setup](/getting-started/authentication) guide to make API calls
3. Use your private key to sign JWT assertions and obtain access tokens
