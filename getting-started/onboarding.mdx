# Onboarding

## Step 1: Generate Your Key Pairs

Generate an RSA key pair for each environment you need access to. You will share only the **public keys** with Polymarket.

```bash
# Replace 'acme' with your company name

# Development
openssl genrsa -out acme_dev_private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in acme_dev_private_key.pem -pubout -out acme_dev_public_key.pem

# Pre-production
openssl genrsa -out acme_preprod_private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in acme_preprod_private_key.pem -pubout -out acme_preprod_public_key.pem

# Production
openssl genrsa -out acme_prod_private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in acme_prod_private_key.pem -pubout -out acme_prod_public_key.pem
```

Keep your private keys secure. Never share them with anyone.

## Step 2: Submit Your Onboarding Request

Email **onboarding@polymarket.com** with:
- Your firm name
- A Google Drive link containing your public key file(s) (grant Editor access to `onboarding@polymarket.com`)

The Polymarket team will follow up with next steps and provide your Client ID credentials.
