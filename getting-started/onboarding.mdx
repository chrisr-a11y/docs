# Onboarding

Complete this onboarding process before you can authenticate and access the API.

## Step 1: Generate Your Key Pair

Generate an RSA key pair. You will share only the **public key** with Polymarket.

```bash
# Generate a 2048-bit RSA private key
openssl genrsa -out my_private_key.pem 2048

# Extract the public key
openssl rsa -in my_private_key.pem -pubout -out my_public_key.pem

# Generate the key fingerprint (you'll need this for verification)
openssl rsa -pubin -in my_public_key.pem -fingerprint -noout
```

<Warning>
**CRITICAL: Protect Your Private Key!**

Your private key (`my_private_key.pem`) must NEVER be shared with anyone, including Polymarket. If your private key is compromised:

- **Your ISV account is at risk of unauthorized access**
- **Contact Polymarket immediately to rotate your credentials**
- Email: fixapi@polymarket.com

Secure your private key:
```bash
chmod 600 my_private_key.pem
```

Store it in encrypted storage or a secrets manager. Never commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create Your Onboarding Folder

Create a Google Drive folder for your onboarding submission:

1. Create a new folder in Google Drive named: **"[Your Company Name] - Polymarket API Onboarding"**

2. Add the following to the folder:
   - **Your public key file** (`my_public_key.pem`) - upload the actual file
   - **Onboarding document** - a Google Doc following the [Onboarding Template](/getting-started/onboarding-template)

3. Share the folder with **Editor** access to:
   - `chris.rodier@qcex.com`
   - `nick.rice@qcex.com`

<Note>
**Upload the public key FILE, not the contents.** We need the actual `.pem` file in your shared folder.
</Note>

## Step 3: Verification Call

After you share your onboarding folder:

1. The Polymarket team will review your submission
2. We will contact you using the information in your onboarding document
3. We will schedule a **recorded online meeting** with both Polymarket contacts present

<Warning>
**Identity Verification Required**

During the verification call:
- **Both** Polymarket contacts (Chris Rodier and Nick Rice) will be present
- You must provide **government-issued photo ID** to verify your identity
- The call will be **recorded** for compliance purposes
- You will verbally confirm the fingerprint of your public key

Have your key fingerprint ready (run `openssl rsa -pubin -in my_public_key.pem -fingerprint -noout`).
</Warning>

4. Once identity and key fingerprint are verified, your key will be configured in the authentication system

## Step 4: Start Using the API

After your key is verified and configured:

1. You will receive your **Client ID** and environment details
2. Follow the [Authentication Setup](/getting-started/authentication) guide to make API calls
3. Use your private key to sign JWT assertions and obtain access tokens
