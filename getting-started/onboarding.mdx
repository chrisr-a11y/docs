# Onboarding

Complete this onboarding process before you can authenticate and access the API.

## Step 1: Generate Your Key Pairs

Generate **two RSA key pairs** - one for pre-production (testing) and one for production. You will share only the **public keys** with Polymarket.

```bash
# Generate pre-production keys (for testing)
openssl genrsa -out acme_preprod_private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in acme_preprod_private_key.pem -pubout -out acme_preprod_public_key.pem

# Generate production keys
openssl genrsa -out acme_prod_private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in acme_prod_private_key.pem -pubout -out acme_prod_public_key.pem

# Generate fingerprints for both keys (you'll need these for verification)
openssl rsa -pubin -in acme_preprod_public_key.pem -fingerprint -noout
openssl rsa -pubin -in acme_prod_public_key.pem -fingerprint -noout
```

<Info>
**Key Naming Convention**

Replace `acme` with your firm name. Your keys should be named:
- `{firmname}_preprod_public_key.pem` - for pre-production/testing
- `{firmname}_prod_public_key.pem` - for production

Both environments require separate keys for security isolation.
</Info>

<Warning>
**CRITICAL: Protect Your Private Key!**

Your private key (`my_private_key.pem`) must NEVER be shared with anyone, including Polymarket. If your private key is compromised:

- **Your ISV account is at risk of unauthorized access**
- **Contact Polymarket immediately to rotate your credentials**
- Email: api-onboarding@qcex.com

Secure your private key:
```bash
chmod 600 my_private_key.pem
```

Store it in encrypted storage or a secrets manager. Never commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create Your Onboarding Folder

Create a Google Drive folder for your onboarding submission:

1. Create a new folder in Google Drive named: **"[Your Company Name] - Polymarket API Onboarding"**

2. Add the following files to the folder:
   - **Pre-production public key** (`{firmname}_preprod_public_key.pem`) - for testing
   - **Production public key** (`{firmname}_prod_public_key.pem`) - for production
   - **Onboarding document** - a Google Doc named **"{Firm Name} API Onboarding"** following the [Onboarding Template](/getting-started/onboarding-template)

3. Share the folder with **Viewer** access to: `api-onboarding@qcex.com`

<Note>
**Upload the public key FILES, not the contents.** We need both actual `.pem` files in your shared folder - one for preprod and one for production.
</Note>

## Step 3: Verification Call

After you share your onboarding folder:

1. The Polymarket team will review your submission
2. We will contact you using the information in your onboarding document
3. We will schedule a **recorded online meeting** with both Polymarket contacts present

<Warning>
**Identity Verification Required**

During the verification call:
- **Both contacts** from your company (primary and secondary) must be present
- Each contact must provide **government-issued photo ID** to verify their identity
- The call will be **recorded** for compliance purposes
- You will verbally confirm the fingerprints of **both** public keys

Have both key fingerprints ready:
```bash
openssl rsa -pubin -in {firmname}_preprod_public_key.pem -fingerprint -noout
openssl rsa -pubin -in {firmname}_prod_public_key.pem -fingerprint -noout
```
</Warning>

4. Once identity and key fingerprints are verified, both keys will be configured in the authentication system

## Step 4: Start Using the API

After your key is verified and configured:

1. You will receive your **Client ID** and environment details
2. Follow the [Authentication Setup](/getting-started/authentication) guide to make API calls
3. Use your private key to sign JWT assertions and obtain access tokens
