title: "VPC Connection"
---

## Overview

Connect to Polymarket Exchange's Trading API using AWS PrivateLink for secure, private network connectivity. This guide walks you through setting up a VPC Endpoint connection for both pre-production and production environments.

<Note>
Your AWS account must be whitelisted before you can establish a VPC connection. Contact Polymarket support to whitelist your account.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account whitelisted by Polymarket
- Appropriate permissions to create VPC Endpoints in AWS
- Subnets in the required Availability Zones (see below)

## 1. Account and Environment Setup

We recommend using separate AWS accounts for pre-production and production environments to maintain clear isolation.

- **By default**, your whitelisted AWS account has access to **Preprod only**
- When ready for production, provide Polymarket with your production AWS Account ID for whitelisting

## 2. Create VPC Endpoint

Navigate to the AWS Console and create a new VPC Endpoint using the appropriate VPC Service Name:

| Environment | VPC Service Name |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Preprod** | `com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0ab4dc57271d74d3e` |
| **Prod** | `com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0cb1220f882b3879e` |

### Availability Zone Requirements

Ensure at least one of your subnets is located in the following Availability Zone IDs:

**Production:**
- `use1-az1`
- `use1-az2`
- `use1-az6`

**Pre-Production:**
- `use1-az1`
- `use1-az2`
- `use1-az4`

<Warning>
AWS randomly maps Availability Zones to physical Zone IDs per account. Verify that the Zone IDs match your account's mapping. Learn more in the [AWS Availability Zones documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-availability-zones).
</Warning>

### Connection Approval

After creating the VPC Endpoint, a connection request is sent to Polymarket's DevOps team. They will review and accept the request, then notify you once approved.

<Note>
You cannot proceed with DNS configuration or API connection until Polymarket accepts the connection request.
</Note>

## 3. PrivateLink DNS Configuration

After the connection is accepted, we recommend enabling Private DNS for the endpoint (optional but encouraged).

When Private DNS is enabled, the following DNS names resolve to private IP addresses assigned to your VPC Endpoint, routing all traffic over the private AWS network:

| Environment | Private DNS Name |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Preprod** | `traderapi.us-east-1.privatelink.preprod.polymarketexchange.com` |
| **Prod** | `traderapi.us-east-1.privatelink.prod.polymarketexchange.com` |

## 4. Making API Calls

### HTTP REST API

Send REST API requests to the Private DNS name with the Host header override:

<Note>
**You must set the Host header** or you will receive errors when making REST requests.
</Note>

| Environment | Host Header |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Preprod** | `rest.preprod.polymarketexchange.com` |
| **Prod** | `rest.prod.polymarketexchange.com` |

**Example (Preprod):**

```bash
curl "https://traderapi.us-east-1.privatelink.preprod.polymarketexchange.com/v1/accounts/whoami" \
  -H "Host: rest.preprod.polymarketexchange.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "accept: application/json"
```

### gRPC API

When making gRPC calls, set the `:authority` header (gRPC equivalent of the Host header). This ensures continuity if the VPC Endpoint's private DNS name changes due to redeployment or regional expansion.

| Environment | Authority Header |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Preprod** | `traderapi.preprod.polymarketexchange.com` |
| **Prod** | `traderapi.prod.polymarketexchange.com` |

**Example (Preprod):**

```bash
grpcurl -authority traderapi.preprod.polymarketexchange.com \
  traderapi.us-east-1.privatelink.preprod.polymarketexchange.com:443 list
```

### Alternative: CNAME Aliases

Instead of using Host and `:authority` headers, your infrastructure team can create CNAME aliases for the hostnames via a Route53 Private Hosted Zone. This approach simplifies client configuration and eliminates the need for header overrides.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection request not accepted">
    If your connection request hasn't been accepted after 24 hours, contact Polymarket support with your VPC Endpoint ID.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DNS resolution fails">
    Verify that Private DNS is enabled for your VPC Endpoint and that your subnets are in the correct Availability Zones.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API calls timing out">
    Ensure your security groups and network ACLs allow outbound HTTPS (443) traffic to the VPC Endpoint.
