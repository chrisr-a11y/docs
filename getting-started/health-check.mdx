# Health Check

The Health Check endpoint allows you to verify the API service status before making trading requests. Both REST and gRPC health checks are available.

## REST Health Check

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/health` | Check service health status |

### Request

```bash
curl https://api.prod.polymarketexchange.com/v1/health
```

No authentication is required for the health check endpoint.

### Response

```json
{"status": "ok"}
```

---

## gRPC Health Check

| Service | Method |
|---------|--------|
| `polymarket.v1.HealthAPI` | `HealthCheck` |

### Request

```bash
grpcurl grpc.prod.polymarketexchange.com:443 polymarket.v1.HealthAPI/HealthCheck
```

### Response

```json
{"status": "ok"}
```

## Environment Endpoints

| Environment | REST | gRPC |
|-------------|------|------|
| **Dev** | `https://api.dev01.polymarketexchange.com/v1/health` | `grpc.dev01.polymarketexchange.com:443` |
| **Preprod** | `https://api.preprod.polymarketexchange.com/v1/health` | `grpc.preprod.polymarketexchange.com:443` |
| **Prod** | `https://api.prod.polymarketexchange.com/v1/health` | `grpc.prod.polymarketexchange.com:443` |

## Use Cases

### Pre-flight Check

Before initiating trading operations, verify the API is healthy:

```python
import requests

def check_health(env="prod"):
    url = f"https://api.{env}.polymarketexchange.com/v1/health"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200 and response.json().get("status") == "ok":
        return True
    return False

if check_health("prod"):
    # Proceed with trading operations
    pass
else:
    # Handle service unavailability
    pass
```

### Monitoring

Use the health endpoint for:

- **Load balancer health checks** - Configure your load balancer to poll this endpoint
- **Alerting systems** - Set up alerts when the endpoint fails
- **Dashboard status** - Display real-time service status in your application

## Best Practices

1. **Don't over-poll** - Check health at reasonable intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds)
2. **Implement retry logic** - Transient failures can occur; retry before alerting
3. **Cache results** - Don't check health before every API call
4. **Handle gracefully** - If health check fails, queue operations and retry later
