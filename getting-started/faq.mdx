  <Accordion title="Does /search-trades return my trades only, or all exchange trades?">
    **`/search-trades` returns only trades for your authenticated user**, not exchange-wide trades.

    The endpoint uses participant-scoped authentication, meaning:

    1. **Per-User Token**: Your Auth0 JWT is exchanged for a participant token scoped to your `participant_id`
    2. **Automatic Filtering**: The exchange automatically filters results to trades where you are a party (buyer or seller)
    3. **No Cross-User Access**: You cannot see other participants' trades

    The same scoping applies to related endpoints:
    - `/search-orders` - only your orders
    - `/search-executions` - only your executions
    - `/positions/list` - only your positions
    - `/accounts/balance` - only your account balances

    <Note>
    If you need exchange-wide trade data (e.g., for market analysis), use the public market data endpoints or the market data stream instead.
