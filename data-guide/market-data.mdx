# Market Data

This guide covers how to access market data from the Polymarket Exchange for read-only consumption.

## Overview

Market data includes:

- **Best Bid/Offer (BBO)** - Current best prices
- **L2 Order Book** - Full depth of market
- **Trades** - Executed transactions

## Required Scopes

| Scope | Data Access |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:marketdata` | BBO, streaming market data |
| `read:l2marketdata` | Full L2 order book depth |

## REST API Endpoints

### Get Best Bid/Offer

Retrieve the current best bid and offer for a symbol:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.preprod.polymarketexchange.com/v1/orderbook/{symbol}/bbo" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTCUSD-2024-01-YES",
  "bid": {
    "price": "0.65",
    "size": "1000"
  },
  "ask": {
    "price": "0.67",
    "size": "500"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Get L2 Order Book

Retrieve the full order book depth:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.preprod.polymarketexchange.com/v1/orderbook/{symbol}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTCUSD-2024-01-YES",
  "bids": [
    {"price": "0.65", "size": "1000"},
    {"price": "0.64", "size": "2000"},
    {"price": "0.63", "size": "1500"}
  ],
  "asks": [
    {"price": "0.67", "size": "500"},
    {"price": "0.68", "size": "800"},
    {"price": "0.69", "size": "1200"}
  ],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Streaming Market Data (gRPC)

For real-time updates, use the gRPC [Market Data Stream](/streaming-endpoints/market-data-stream).

### Subscribe to Market Data

```python
import grpc
from polymarket_pb2 import MarketDataRequest
from polymarket_pb2_grpc import MarketDataServiceStub

# Create channel with credentials
channel = grpc.secure_channel(
    'grpc.preprod.polymarketexchange.com:443',
    grpc.ssl_channel_credentials()
)

stub = MarketDataServiceStub(channel)

# Subscribe to symbols
request = MarketDataRequest(
    symbols=["BTCUSD-2024-01-YES", "ETHUSD-2024-01-YES"]
)

# Stream updates
for update in stub.Subscribe(request, metadata=[('authorization', f'Bearer {token}')]):
    print(f"Symbol: {update.symbol}, Bid: {update.bid}, Ask: {update.ask}")
```

## Best Practices

### Rate Limits

- REST endpoints are subject to [rate limits](/getting-started/rate-limits)
- Use streaming (gRPC) for real-time data to reduce API calls
- Cache reference data locally

### Connection Management

- Implement reconnection logic for streaming connections
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Use heartbeats to detect connection issues

### Data Handling

- Validate timestamps to detect stale data
- Handle gaps in sequence numbers appropriately
- Store historical data locally for analysis
