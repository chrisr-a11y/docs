The underlying EP3 API provides snapshot+streaming for many use cases. Where such a use case exists, any polling-based APIs should not be used by anyone external. Or they should be severely rate limited such that they are not useful for anything more than an occasional query. They put undue strain on the database. E.g. The underlying get_trade_stats (GetTradeStats), and similar. We do not have a data analytics database setup for external access that is optimized for high query load and our primary database getting overloaded puts risk on our lag from system -> database for the persistent writes. There are future infra solutions to help this but currently it is a limitation as we have not had the time to properly do the database optimization and setup for these high-load queries. We should either (a) not provide the documentation for the problematic APIs or (b) put a clear warning on them that low rate limits may be imposed at any time and tell people the correct use of the APIs is to snapshot/stream
Currently JUMP is using the incorrectly and putting a big  strain on the database
I know there is a page that says it's a "streaming first" API setup but the specific APIs which have corresponding streaming options should say it on those individual API docs so developers (who will only skip to the API parts) will be directed to the right place (or direct them to the streaming api docs page but ideally to the appropriate streaming api for the polling one they are looking at)

It's not clear what APIs are intended for the ISV partners who are providing access to Retail Traders vs APIs for Trading. I would strongly suggest bifurcating the API docs to ensure the ISV-specific section is clearly in a different page/hierarchy than the trading APIs - this will limit the confusion, incorrect implementations, and questions fielded by our internal teams about them.


On the message flow diagrams, Polymarket Gateway and Polymarket US should not be represented as separate Actors. From outside, they are "Polymarket US" performing all the actions (how we separate services internally is our business).


The terminology "Auth0 Access Token" is n/a from the outside perspective. We only make that distinction internally because we know there are various types of JWTs but externally, it's just the Polymarket US API Access Token (which happens to be issued by Auth0 but even that is not an implantation detail we need to have in the docs as the domains that the token issuance will access can be our subdomains.
https://auth0.com/docs/customize/custom-domains —> e.g. we can have tokens.polymarketexchange.com be where all the token exchange/generation calls are made to and that is just white labeled Auth0 but it means the docs are clean and if we chose to swap out auth0 it would be reasonably transparent
