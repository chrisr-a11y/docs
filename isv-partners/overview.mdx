# ISV Partner Guide

This guide is for **Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)** building retail trading platforms on top of Polymarket US. If you're building a platform that onboards end-users for trading, this section is for you.

<Info>
**What is an ISV?**

An ISV (Independent Software Vendor) is a partner that builds a consumer-facing trading application. ISVs manage their own users, handle KYC verification, process deposits and withdrawals, and execute trades on behalf of their customers.

    A[KYC Verification] --> B{Approved?}
    B -->|Yes| C[User Auto-Created]
    C --> D[Funding]
    D --> E[Trading]
    E --> F[Positions]
    F --> G[Withdrawal]
    B -->|No| H[Rejected]
```

<Info>
**Automatic User Creation**

Users are created automatically when KYC verification is approved. There is no separate account creation step - the system provisions EP3 trading resources as part of the KYC approval process.
</Info>

### 1. Identity Verification (KYC)

  - `POST /v1/aeropay/initialize` - Link bank account
  - `POST /v1/checkout/deposits` - Process card deposit
