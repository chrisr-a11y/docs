# Frequently Asked Questions

## Trader FAQs

These FAQs are for **DMA Participants** (Direct Market Access traders) using the Polymarket Exchange API.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the Polymarket Exchange?">
    The Polymarket Exchange is a CFTC-regulated exchange for trading event contracts. DMA participants can trade directly on the exchange using the API, with real-time market data and order execution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get started as a trader?">
    To start trading on the Polymarket Exchange:

    1. Complete the [Onboarding](/getting-started/onboarding) process
    2. Generate your RSA key pairs for authentication
    3. Set up [Authentication](/getting-started/authentication) with Private Key JWT
    4. Follow the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) guide to place your first order
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the trading hours?">
    The Polymarket Exchange operates 24/7 for most markets. Specific instruments may have different trading hours based on the underlying event. Check the instrument metadata for trading schedule details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the fees for trading?">
    Trading fees vary by instrument and order type. Contact Polymarket for the current fee schedule. Fees are deducted from your account balance when trades execute.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the position limits?">
    Position limits are set per instrument and per account. These limits are enforced to manage risk. Check with Polymarket for specific limit details for your account type.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I fund my trading account?">
    DMA participants typically fund accounts through wire transfer or other approved methods. Contact **onboarding@polymarket.com** for funding instructions specific to your account setup.

    <Note>
    Unlike retail users who use Aeropay or Checkout.com, DMA participants have different funding arrangements.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does /search-trades return my trades only, or all exchange trades?">
    **`/search-trades` returns only trades for your authenticated user**, not exchange-wide trades.

    The endpoint uses participant-scoped authentication, meaning:

    1. **Per-User Token**: Your Auth0 JWT is exchanged for a participant token scoped to your `participant_id`
    2. **Automatic Filtering**: The exchange automatically filters results to trades where you are a party (buyer or seller)
    3. **No Cross-User Access**: You cannot see other participants' trades

    The same scoping applies to related endpoints:
    - `/search-orders` - only your orders
    - `/search-executions` - only your executions
    - `/positions/list` - only your positions
    - `/accounts/balance` - only your account balances

    <Note>
    If you need exchange-wide trade data (e.g., for market analysis), use the public market data endpoints or the market data stream instead.

## Partner FAQs

These FAQs are for **Partners** (ISVs, Independent Brokers, and FCMs) integrating with the Polymarket Exchange.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a Participant ID?">
    A **Participant ID** is the unique identifier for an individual trading user on the Polymarket Exchange. It represents the identity of the person authorized to trade.

    **Format:**
    ```
    firms/[PARTICIPANT_FIRM]/users/[USER_ID]
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```
    firms/ISV-Participant-Acme/users/user-abc-123
    ```

    **Components:**
    - `[PARTICIPANT_FIRM]`: Your ISV's participant firm name (assigned during onboarding)
    - `[USER_ID]`: The user identifier you provide during KYC provisioning

    **How it's used:**
    1. **Token Creation**: Your Auth0 JWT is exchanged for a participant-scoped trading token via `/v1/participant/token`
    2. **Trading Operations**: All orders are placed and tracked under your participant ID
    3. **Audit Trail**: Trades, executions, and positions are attributed to your participant ID
    4. **Funding**: Deposits and withdrawals are scoped to your participant's account

    **When it's created:**
    Your participant ID is automatically provisioned when you complete KYC verification. The ID is returned in the KYC response and stored for subsequent API calls.

    <Note>
    Each user has exactly one participant ID. All trading activity for that user is associated with this single identity.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does my participant_id contain 'ISV-Participant'?">
    The `ISV-Participant-{name}` portion is the **firm name**, not a description of the user.

    **Example:**
    ```
    firms/ISV-Participant-Alice/users/bob
    ```

    | Component | Meaning |
    |-----------|---------|
    | `ISV-Participant-Alice` | Alice's firm (where users are created) |
    | `bob` | The end user's username |

    This is the expected format. All users belonging to an ISV have the ISV's firm name in their participant_id.

    <Note>
    The "ISV" prefix is a naming convention for the firm, not an indicator that the user is an ISV. Your end users are correctly provisioned under your firm.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I onboard my end users?">
    Partners onboard end users through the KYC verification flow:

    1. Create a user record via the API
    2. Initiate KYC verification for the user
    3. User completes identity verification
    4. Upon approval, the user receives a participant ID
    5. User can now trade under your firm

    See the [KYC Verification](/isv-partners/kyc/overview) guide for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle payments for my users?">
    Partners can integrate payment methods for their users:

    - **Aeropay**: Bank account linking for deposits/withdrawals
    - **Checkout.com**: Card-based deposits

    See the [Payments Overview](/isv-partners/payments/overview) for integration details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What webhooks are available?">
    Polymarket provides webhooks for real-time notifications:

    - KYC status changes
    - Funding events
    - User account updates

    See [Webhooks](/isv-partners/kyc/webhooks) for setup instructions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## General FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which environments are available?">
    Polymarket provides three environments:

    |-------------|---------|
    | Development | Initial integration and testing |
    | Pre-production | Final testing before go-live |

    Each environment requires separate credentials. See [Environments](/getting-started/environments) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What authentication method is used?">
