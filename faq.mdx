  <Accordion title="What is a Participant ID?">
    A **Participant ID** is the unique identifier for an individual trading user on the Polymarket Exchange. It represents the identity of the person authorized to trade.

    **Format:**
    ```
    firms/[PARTICIPANT_FIRM]/users/[USER_ID]
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```
    firms/ISV-Participant-Acme/users/user-abc-123
    ```

    **Components:**
    - `[PARTICIPANT_FIRM]`: Your ISV's participant firm name (assigned during onboarding)
    - `[USER_ID]`: The user identifier you provide during KYC provisioning

    **How it's used:**
    1. **Token Creation**: Your Auth0 JWT is exchanged for a participant-scoped trading token via `/v1/participant/token`
    2. **Trading Operations**: All orders are placed and tracked under your participant ID
    3. **Audit Trail**: Trades, executions, and positions are attributed to your participant ID
    4. **Funding**: Deposits and withdrawals are scoped to your participant's account

    **When it's created:**
    Your participant ID is automatically provisioned when you complete KYC verification. The ID is returned in the KYC response and stored for subsequent API calls.

    <Note>
    Each user has exactly one participant ID. All trading activity for that user is associated with this single identity.

  <Accordion title="Does /search-trades return my trades only, or all exchange trades?">
    **`/search-trades` returns only trades for your authenticated user**, not exchange-wide trades.

    The endpoint uses participant-scoped authentication, meaning:

    1. **Per-User Token**: Your Auth0 JWT is exchanged for a participant token scoped to your `participant_id`
    2. **Automatic Filtering**: The exchange automatically filters results to trades where you are a party (buyer or seller)
    3. **No Cross-User Access**: You cannot see other participants' trades

    The same scoping applies to related endpoints:
    - `/search-orders` - only your orders
    - `/search-executions` - only your executions
    - `/positions/list` - only your positions
    - `/accounts/balance` - only your account balances

    <Note>
    If you need exchange-wide trade data (e.g., for market analysis), use the public market data endpoints or the market data stream instead.
