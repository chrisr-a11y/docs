# Order Book API

The Order Book API provides real-time access to aggregated order book data for any trading instrument. This API is designed for applications that need quick snapshots of market depth without maintaining a streaming connection.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/orderbook/{symbol}` | Get L2 order book snapshot |
| `GET` | `/v1/orderbook/{symbol}/bbo` | Get best bid/offer |

## L2 Order Book

The L2 (Level 2) order book provides aggregated price levels showing the total quantity available at each price point. This is useful for:

- Understanding market depth at different price levels
- Analyzing liquidity distribution
- Building trading strategies based on order book imbalance

### Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `symbol` | string | Yes | Instrument symbol (e.g., "BTC-USD") |
| `depth` | integer | No | Number of price levels to return (default: 3, max: 10) |

### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `symbol` | string | Instrument symbol |
| `bids` | array | Bid side of order book (sorted by price descending) |
| `offers` | array | Offer/ask side of order book (sorted by price ascending) |
| `state` | string | Current trading state of the instrument |
| `stats` | object | Market statistics (last trade, OHLC, etc.) |
| `transactTime` | datetime | Server timestamp of the data |

### Book Entry Structure

Each entry in the `bids` and `offers` arrays contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `px` | string | Price level |
| `qty` | string | Total quantity at this price |
| `symbolSubType` | string | Symbol sub-type identifier |

## Best Bid/Offer (BBO)

The BBO endpoint returns only the top of book - the best (highest) bid and best (lowest) offer. This is the most efficient way to get current market prices.

### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `symbol` | string | Instrument symbol |
| `bestBid` | object | Best bid (highest buy price) |
| `bestOffer` | object | Best offer (lowest sell price) |
| `spread` | string | Spread in price units (best_offer.px - best_bid.px) |
| `midPrice` | string | Mid price ((best_bid.px + best_offer.px) / 2) |
| `state` | string | Current trading state |
| `transactTime` | datetime | Server timestamp |

## Instrument States

The `state` field indicates the current trading status:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `INSTRUMENT_STATE_OPEN` | Instrument is open for trading |
| `INSTRUMENT_STATE_PREOPEN` | Instrument is in pre-open phase |
| `INSTRUMENT_STATE_SUSPENDED` | Trading is temporarily suspended |
| `INSTRUMENT_STATE_EXPIRED` | Instrument has expired |
| `INSTRUMENT_STATE_TERMINATED` | Instrument has been terminated |
| `INSTRUMENT_STATE_HALTED` | Trading is halted |
| `INSTRUMENT_STATE_MATCH_AND_CLOSE_AUCTION` | In closing auction phase |

## Example Usage

### Get L2 Order Book

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.polymarketexchange.com/rest/api/v1/orderbook/BTC-USD?depth=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Get BBO

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.polymarketexchange.com/rest/api/v1/orderbook/BTC-USD/bbo" \

```

## When to Use

- **Order Book Snapshot**: Use when you need to see multiple price levels and understand market depth
- **BBO**: Use when you only need the current best prices (more efficient, smaller payload)

For real-time streaming order book updates, see the [gRPC Market Data Stream](/streaming-endpoints/market-data-stream) documentation.
