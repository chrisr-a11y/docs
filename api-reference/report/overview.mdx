# Report API

<Warning>
**Prefer Streaming for Real-Time Updates**

This polling API is subject to rate limits. For production applications that need continuous order and trade updates, use the [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) instead. The streaming API provides real-time execution reports as they happen.
</Warning>

The Report API provides search and export capabilities for historical order and trade data.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/v1/orders/search` | Search orders with filters |
| `POST` | `/v1/trades/search` | Search trades with filters |
| `GET` | `/v1/reports/orders` | Export orders to CSV |
| `GET` | `/v1/reports/trades` | Export trades to CSV |

## When to Use

| Use Case | Recommended API |
|----------|-----------------|
| Real-time order status updates | [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) |
| Real-time fill notifications | [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) |
| Historical order lookup | REST Orders Search (this API) |
| End-of-day reconciliation | REST Reports Export |
| Audit and compliance reports | REST Reports Export |

<Tip>
**Streaming First Architecture**

For any use case requiring real-time order or trade updates, use the streaming API. Use the REST Report API only for:
- Historical data queries
- One-time lookups
- Batch exports for reporting
</Tip>

## Search vs Export

- **Search endpoints** (`/v1/orders/search`, `/v1/trades/search`): Return paginated JSON results for programmatic access
- **Export endpoints** (`/v1/reports/orders`, `/v1/reports/trades`): Return CSV files for spreadsheet analysis and reporting

## Common Filters

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `symbols` | Filter by trading symbols |
| `accounts` | Filter by trading accounts |
| `startTime` / `endTime` | Date range filter |
| `states` | Order states (NEW, FILLED, CANCELED, etc.) |
| `sides` | BUY or SELL |

See the individual endpoint documentation for complete filter options.
