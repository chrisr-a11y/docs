# Report API

<Warning>
**Prefer Streaming for Real-Time Updates**

This polling API is subject to rate limits. For production applications that need continuous order and trade updates, use the [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) instead. The streaming API provides real-time execution reports as they happen.
</Warning>

The Report API provides search and export capabilities for historical order, trade, and valuation data.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/v1/report/orders/search` | Search orders with filters |
| `POST` | `/v1/report/trades/search` | Search trades with filters |
| `POST` | `/v1/report/executions/search` | Search executions with filters |
| `POST` | `/v1/report/orders/csv` | Export orders to CSV |
| `POST` | `/v1/report/trades/csv` | Export trades to CSV |
| `POST` | `/v1/report/executions/csv` | Export executions to CSV |
| `POST` | `/v1/report/trades/stats` | Get aggregated trade statistics |
| `GET` | `/v1/valuations/positions` | List position valuations (mark-to-market) |
| `GET` | `/v1/valuations/positions/download` | Download position valuations as CSV |

<Info>
**No Participant ID Required for Trade Stats**

The `/v1/report/trades/stats` endpoint only requires Auth0 JWT authentication with `read:reports` scope. You do not need to provide the `x-participant-id` header or complete KYC onboarding to access aggregated trade statistics.

Note: Other report endpoints (orders search, trades search, etc.) still require participant_id.
</Info>

## When to Use

| Use Case | Recommended API |
|----------|-----------------|
| Real-time order status updates | [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) |
| Real-time fill notifications | [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) |
| Historical order lookup | REST Orders Search (this API) |
| End-of-day reconciliation | REST Reports Export |
| Audit and compliance reports | REST Reports Export |

<Tip>
**Streaming First Architecture**

For any use case requiring real-time order or trade updates, use the streaming API. Use the REST Report API only for:
- Historical data queries
- One-time lookups
- Batch exports for reporting
</Tip>

## Search vs Export

- **Search endpoints** (`/v1/report/orders/search`, `/v1/report/trades/search`, `/v1/report/executions/search`): Return paginated JSON results for programmatic access
- **Export endpoints** (`/v1/report/orders/csv`, `/v1/report/trades/csv`, `/v1/report/executions/csv`): Return CSV file streams for spreadsheet analysis and reporting

## Common Filters

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `symbols` | Filter by trading symbols |
| `accounts` | Filter by trading accounts |
| `startTime` / `endTime` | Date range filter |
| `states` | Order states (NEW, FILLED, CANCELED, etc.) |
| `sides` | BUY or SELL |

See the individual endpoint documentation for complete filter options.

## Valuation API

The Valuation API provides mark-to-market (MTM) valuations for positions, calculating market value and unrealized P&L.

<Warning>
**Rate Limit: 5 requests per minute**

The Valuation API has a stricter rate limit of 5 requests per minute per account. Use this API for periodic reporting, not real-time monitoring.
</Warning>

### Mark Price Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `MARK_PRICE_TYPE_LAST` | Last traded price (default) |
| `MARK_PRICE_TYPE_VWAP` | Volume-weighted average price (notional / volume) |
| `MARK_PRICE_TYPE_MID` | Mid price ((high + low) / 2) |

### Valuation Data

Each position valuation includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `netPosition` | Current net position quantity |
| `cost` | Total cost basis (scaled integer) |
| `markPrice` | Mark price used for valuation |
| `marketValue` | Position market value = net_position x mark_price |
| `unrealizedPnl` | Unrealized P&L = market_value - cost |
| `realized` | Realized profit/loss |
| `valuationTime` | Time of valuation |

### Account Summary

The response includes an account-level summary with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `totalCost` | Sum of all position costs |
| `totalMarketValue` | Sum of all position market values |
| `totalUnrealizedPnl` | Sum of all unrealized P&L |
| `totalRealizedPnl` | Sum of all realized P&L |
| `positionCount` | Number of positions |

### Historical Valuations

Query valuations as they existed at a specific point in time:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `as_of_time` | RFC3339 timestamp | Exact point-in-time (e.g., `2026-01-02T17:00:00Z`) |
| `as_of_date` | Date object | End-of-trading-day snapshot (year, month, day) |

<Warning>
**Mutually Exclusive**: Use `as_of_time` OR `as_of_date`, not both.
</Warning>
