# Accounts API

The Accounts API provides user and account management capabilities for ISV partners managing retail traders.

<Info>
**ISV Partner API**

This API is primarily used by ISV partners (Independent Software Vendors) who are building trading platforms for retail users. Direct trading partners typically don't need these endpoints.
