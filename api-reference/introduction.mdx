# REST API Overview

The Polymarket US REST API provides programmatic access to trading, account management, market data, and funding operations.

<Note>
This documentation is specific to Polymarket US. The international version can be found [here](https://docs.polymarket.com/).
</Note>

## Streaming First Architecture

<Warning>
**Use gRPC Streaming for Real-Time Data**

For production applications requiring continuous data updates, use the [gRPC Streaming APIs](/streaming-endpoints/grpc-overview) instead of polling REST endpoints. Streaming provides:

- **Real-time updates** as they happen
- **No rate limiting** concerns
- **Lower latency** than polling
- **Reduced infrastructure load**

REST APIs are subject to rate limits and are best suited for one-time queries, historical data, and administrative operations.
</Warning>

| Use Case | Recommended API |
|----------|-----------------|
| Real-time market data | [gRPC Market Data Stream](/streaming-endpoints/market-data-stream) |
| Real-time order/trade updates | [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) |
| Order entry/cancellation | REST Trading API |
| Historical data queries | REST Report API |
| Account management | REST Accounts API |
| KYC and payments | REST Partner APIs |

## Base URLs

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| Development | `https://api.dev01.polymarketexchange.com` |
| Pre-production | `https://api.preprod.polymarketexchange.com` |
| Production | `https://api.prod.polymarketexchange.com` |

All endpoints use the `/v1/` path prefix.

## Authentication

All API requests require an access token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.preprod.polymarketexchange.com/v1/accounts/whoami" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Warning>
Access tokens expire every **3 minutes**. Implement automatic token refresh in your application.
</Warning>

See the [Authentication Setup Guide](/getting-started/authentication) for complete authentication setup.

## API Groups

### Trading APIs

For direct trading operations. Used by all partners.

| Endpoint Group | Description | Streaming Alternative |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Trading** | Insert, cancel, and replace orders | - |
| **Report** | Search orders and trades, download history | [Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) |
| **Positions** | Query account balances and positions | - |
| **Reference Data** | List instruments, symbols, and metadata | - |
| **Order Book** | Get order book depth and best bid/offer | [Market Data Stream](/streaming-endpoints/market-data-stream) |

<Info>
**Which APIs do I need?**

- **Direct trading partners**: Use the Trading APIs documented in this section
- **Retail partners**: Use Trading APIs plus the [Partner Guide](/isv-partners/overview) APIs
</Info>

## Request Format

### Headers

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Authorization` | Yes | `Bearer {access_token}` |
| `Content-Type` | Yes | `application/json` |

### Request Body

POST requests accept JSON bodies:

```json
{
  "symbol": "mlb-ari-sf-2025-09-08",
  "side": "SIDE_BUY",
  "order_qty": 100,
  "price": 5500,
  "type": "ORDER_TYPE_LIMIT",
  "time_in_force": "TIME_IN_FORCE_GOOD_TILL_CANCEL"
}
```

## Response Format

### Success Response

```json
{
  "order": {
    "id": "ord_abc123",
    "symbol": "mlb-ari-sf-2025-09-08",
    "state": "ORDER_STATE_NEW",
    "order_qty": 100,
    "leaves_qty": 100,
    "cum_qty": 0
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "code": 3,
  "message": "invalid order quantity",
  "details": []
}
```

| HTTP Status | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or expired token |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limited |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

## Price Representation

All prices are represented as `int64` values. Divide by the instrument's `price_scale` to get the decimal price:

```python
# Get price_scale from instrument metadata
instrument = get_instrument("mlb-ari-sf-2025-09-08")
price_scale = instrument.price_scale  # e.g., 10000

# Convert API price to decimal
decimal_price = api_price / price_scale
# 5500 / 10000 = 0.55 ($0.55)
```

<Info>
Query `price_scale` from the Reference Data API (`/v1/refdata/instruments`) and cache it for each instrument.
</Info>

## Rate Limits

The API enforces a rate limit of **20 requests per second per IP address**.

See [Rate Limits](/getting-started/rate-limits) for details on limits and best practices.
