# Trading API

The Trading API provides order entry and management capabilities for the Polymarket Exchange.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/v1/trading/orders` | Insert a new order |
| `POST` | `/v1/trading/orders/cancel` | Cancel an existing order |
| `POST` | `/v1/trading/orders/replace` | Replace/modify an order |
| `POST` | `/v1/trading/orders/preview` | Preview order before submission |

## Order Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `LIMIT` | Limit order at specified price |
| `MARKET_TO_LIMIT` | Market order that converts to limit |
| `STOP` | Stop order |
| `STOP_LIMIT` | Stop-limit order |

## Order Lifecycle

Orders progress through these states:

```
NEW → PARTIALLY_FILLED → FILLED
         ↓
      CANCELED
```

<Tip>
**Real-Time Order Updates**

After submitting orders via REST, use the [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) to receive real-time updates on order status, fills, and cancellations. This is more efficient than polling for order status.
</Tip>

## Time in Force

| TIF | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `DAY` | Good for the trading day |
| `GTC` | Good till canceled |
| `IOC` | Immediate or cancel |
| `FOK` | Fill or kill |

## Best Practices

1. **Use Order Stream for updates** - Don't poll for order status; use streaming
2. **Include client order ID** - Use `clOrdId` for your own order tracking
3. **Preview before submit** - Use the preview endpoint for order validation
4. **Handle rejects** - Implement proper error handling for rejected orders
