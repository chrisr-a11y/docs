## Best Practices

1. **Store funding source IDs** - Cache linked payment methods for faster checkout
2. **Check limits before transactions** - Use the transaction requirements API
3. **Handle all states** - Implement UI for pending, success, and failure
4. **Implement webhooks** - Don't rely solely on polling for status updates
5. **Validate amounts client-side** - Reduce failed API calls
