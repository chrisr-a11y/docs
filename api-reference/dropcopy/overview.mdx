# Drop Copy API

<Warning>
**Prefer Streaming for Real-Time Executions**

This polling API is subject to rate limits. For production applications that need real-time execution notifications, use the [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) instead. The streaming API provides execution reports as they happen with lower latency.
</Warning>

The Drop Copy API provides access to execution data for trade capture and reporting purposes.

## What is Drop Copy?

Drop Copy is a post-trade feed that provides a copy of all executions for your accounts. It's commonly used for:

- Trade capture systems
- Risk management
- Compliance monitoring
- Reconciliation

## When to Use

| Use Case | Recommended API |
|----------|-----------------|
| Real-time execution notifications | [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) |
| Real-time risk monitoring | [gRPC Order Stream](/streaming-endpoints/order-stream) |
| Historical execution queries | REST Drop Copy (this API) |
| End-of-day reconciliation | REST Drop Copy (this API) |

<Tip>
**Streaming First Architecture**

For real-time trade capture and risk monitoring, always use the gRPC Order Stream. The streaming API provides:
- Immediate execution notifications
- Full execution details including fills and rejects
- No polling overhead or rate limit concerns

Use the REST Drop Copy API only for historical queries and batch reconciliation.
</Tip>

## Execution Types

The drop copy feed includes all execution types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `NEW` | Order accepted |
| `PARTIAL_FILL` | Partial execution |
| `FILL` | Complete execution |
| `CANCELED` | Order canceled |
| `REJECTED` | Order rejected |
| `REPLACED` | Order modified |
