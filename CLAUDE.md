This is a Mintlify documentation site which currently 
documents the polymarket existing API exchange docs.

We are releasing a new API, which is adjacent to this folder in go-exchange-gateway-us.

This new API, has everyting the old API has.  FIX, will remain
the same as the existing instructions.  gRPC and REST
shoujld match the new code, which, is nearly identical to 
the existing site, as it is a proxy.  We added order book
l2 and orderbook bbo for example.  Otherwise, it should be
similar or identical.

Review these docs here, and the new gateay, and make 
a new branch here which we can deploy to a new URL on mintlify.

We salso have asdded KYC, Aeropay and checkout, and health.

We removed basic auth for now. 

Those shoujld be changes you find, and tehre are otehrs
